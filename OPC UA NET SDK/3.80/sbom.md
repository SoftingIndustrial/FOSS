## Reciprocal Community License 1.0

Reciprocal Community License 1.00 (RCL1.00)
Version 1.00, June 24, 2009
Copyright (C) 2008,2009 OPC Foundation, Inc., All Rights Reserved.

PREAMBLE

The Reciprocal Community License (RCL) is based on the concept of reciprocity or, if you prefer, fairness.

The RCL is adapted from the Open Source Reciprocal Public License (RPL) where the “Public” in the Open Source RPL license is replaced by the “Community” in the RCL License. In short, the RPL license grew out of a desire to close loopholes in previous open source licenses, loopholes that allowed parties to acquire open source software and derive financial benefit from it without having to release their improvements or derivatives to the community which enabled them. This occurred any time an entity did not release their application to a "third party". While there is a certain freedom in this model of licensing, it struck the authors of the RPL as being unfair to the open source community at large and to the original authors of the works in particular. After all, bug fixes, extensions, and meaningful and valuable derivatives were not consistently faster, growth and expansion of the overall open source software base.

While you should clearly read and understand the entire license, the essence of the RCL is found in two definitions: "Deploy" and "Required Components".

Regarding deployment, under the RCL your changes, bug fixes, extensions, etc. must be made available to the community when you Deploy in any form -- either internally or to an outside party.

Once you start running the software you have to start sharing the software. Further, under the RCL all derivative work components you author including schemas, scripts, source code, documentation, etc. -- must be shared. You have to share the whole pie, not an isolated slice of it. The authored components you must share are confined to the original module licensed (e.g. SDK, stack, wrapper, proxy, utility, etc.). You do not need to share any additional authored components that you create that utilize the licensed component. This license is meant to be friendly to commercial software vendors that must protect the IP in their code. You are not expected to share your proprietary source code that makes use of the module(s) licensed under this agreement.

The specific terms and conditions of the license are defined in the remainder of this document.

1 LICENSE TERMS
1.1 General; Applicability & Definitions. This Reciprocal Community License Version 1.00 ("License") applies to any programs or other works as well as any and all updates or maintenance releases of said programs or works ("Software") not already covered by this License which the Software copyright holder ("Licensor") makes available containing a License Notice (hereinafter defined) from the Licensor specifying or allowing use or distribution under the terms of this License. As used in this License:
1.2 "Contributor" means any person or entity who created or contributed to the creation of an Extension.
1.3 "Deploy" means to use, Serve, sublicense or distribute Licensed Software other than for Your internal Research and/or Personal Use, and includes without limitation, any and all internal use or distribution of Licensed Software within Your business or organization other than for Research and/or Personal Use, as well as direct or indirect sublicensing or distribution of Licensed Software by You to any third party.
1.4 "Derivative Works" as used in this License is defined under U.S. copyright law.
1.5 "Extensions" means any Modifications, Derivative Works, or Required Components as those terms are defined in this License.
1.6 "License" means this Reciprocal Community License.

          Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor
             hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
             irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,

             Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent
             infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall
             terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

              If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its distribution, then any
                 Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution
                 notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to
                 any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE
                 text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                 documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated

          Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution
             intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the
             terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.

          Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including
             negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and
             grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for
             damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
             character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work

          Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works
             thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,
             indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However,
             in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole
             responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
